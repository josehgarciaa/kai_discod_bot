Ok, I would like you to assit me in a software design task. I would like to frame a software in the best design patter possible. Then I would like you first to rank in three type of design patterns and to explain me why of each. Please elaborate step by step in the answer. 

The idea is the following,  I would like to have a chatbot using llm and openai. In this sense, I would like the software to have the following usage.

(1) The user will login using API key to the client. At this stage, safe credential managment should be ideal, as well as propoer error handling.

(2) In the second step the user should define the model. In this sense, it should support differnt models and also stablished the kind of input/output if it is allow to search on the internet and if the output is structured or not. 

(3) On the third stage it should deifne the model behavior. This is for example, system prompt, how should be the style tone, background, etc. Format of output, for exmaple markdown, language, etc.

(4) Then, user will be able to open a chat and then submit an initial prompt. 

(5) Then the user will get an answer 

(6) The user should be able to continusly chatting, while behind the scene the whole conversation is storage and repass to the model as assistant primpts. 

(7) The model behavior should be modifible at any point of the chat. 

Interesting things to have. Context keeper, it should be able to know how much context length has been consume. an user profile. IT should be able to assign a chat to an user and define a user from the chats. a log system. The whole chat should be able to print as an output

First of all, could you please divide the software into strategic sections and explain in each case what design pattern should be use and why? Please reasoning before deciding the patterns. 

I asked a gtp model and it answered

Certainly! Let's approach your request in a structured and iterative manner. First, let's restate and organize clearly your software's requirements into high-level strategic sections. Once we identify those sections, we’ll reason about desirable properties for each section. Lastly, we'll discuss and recommend the appropriate design patterns for them.

## 📝 Step 1. Clarify and Group Requirements into Strategic Sections:

Given your description, we can strategically break down your chatbot application into six strategic sections as follows:

1. **User Authentication & Session Management**  
2. **Model Configuration & Behavior Management**  
3. **Chat Context & Conversation Management**  
4. **Prompt Generation and API communication**  
5. **Logging and Output Management**  
6. **Additional features (User profile, Context keeper)**  

---

## ⚙️ Step 2. Desirable Software Design Characteristics and Reasoning:

We evaluate each section by considering desired characteristics typical to software architecture design:

- **Maintainability:** Ease of modification or extension without affecting too much the overall system architecture.
- **Flexibility & Extensibility:** Allow for change and plugin of new functionalities or components.
- **Separation of Concerns:** Each major responsible zone should do only a clearly defined single major responsibility.
- **Testability:** Easy to write unit and integration tests.
- **Reusable components:** Opportunities to reuse code across different sections and parts of the application.
- **Scalable management of complexity:** Keeping simple interfaces for complex logic components.

---

## 🎖 Step 3. Analyzing Strategic Sections Individually & Choosing Design Patterns:

Below we provide reasoning and recommended design patterns for each of your six strategic sections:

### 1\. **User Authentication & Session Management (User’s API Key)**
This includes: Handling user login, credential verification, API Key management, secure storage, error handling clearly and consistently.

#### Recommended Pattern:
- **Singleton Pattern**
- **Facade Pattern**

#### Reasoning: 
- **Singleton** provides an easy global point of access ensuring one consistent state for sessions' credential pipeline.
- **Facade** abstracts the underlying complex, internal API key handling to simplify authentication interface. Facade brings clarity and simplicity, proper separation of concerns.

---

### 2\. **Model Configuration & Behavior Management**
This involves defining models, updates at any time, input-output options (like web searches), and flexibility to dynamically define prompts.

#### Recommended Patterns:
- **Builder Pattern**
- **Strategy Pattern**

#### Reasoning:
- **Builder** allows convenient and structured creation and configuration of a model instance object by sequentially defining features (type, input parameters, output structure).
- **Strategy** allows swapping or updating the core behavior algorithms dynamically. Different "strategies" encapsulate distinct behaviors such as style languages, structured outputs, or internet search access.

---

### 3\. **Chat Context & Conversation Management**
Includes storing messages, managing conversation states, preserving the context, and knowing context length consumption.

#### Recommended Patterns:
- **Memento Pattern**
- **Observer Pattern**

#### Reasoning:
- **Memento** helps persist and track checkout points, preserving states efficiently of conversation and allowing rollback or recovery from intermediate states.
- **Observer** enables real-time updates: whenever conversation changes, certain interested modules (such as "context keeper" or logger) get notified and react accordingly without direct coupling.

---

### 4\. **Prompt Generation & API communication**
Involves building prompt messages to include conversation history, system/user prompt, submitting via OpenAI API and fetching response.

#### Recommended Patterns:
- **Facade Pattern**
- **Chain of Responsibility Pattern**

#### Reasoning:
- **Facade** provides a clean, simplified API interface to encapsulate complexity when communicating with external APIs like OpenAI. Makes the code cleaner, simpler and more maintainable.
- **Chain of Responsibility** can manage custom rules and sequential processing steps before final submit: for example, pre-processing prompt formatting, model-specific tokenizer, calculating input limits, error interception, etc.

---

### 5\. **Logging and Output Management**
Involves keeping logs of conversations, events, errors, printing strongly formatted outputs.

#### Recommended Patterns:
- **Decorator Pattern**
- **Singleton Pattern**

#### Reasoning:
- **Decorator** helps dynamically add logging and auditing functionality to different parts of your conversations, dialogues without changing base interface logic switches.
- **Singleton** establishes global reference points for central logging facility, ensuring resource sharing and global application-level logging consistency.

---

### 6\. **Additional Features (User Profiles, Context Keeper)**
Extendable modules to track the user and context systematically.

### Recommended Patterns:
- **Observer Pattern**
- **Strategy Pattern**

### Reasoning:
- **Observer** keeps modules loosely coupled. Additional functionality like user profiles or context keeping just can get notified on events occurring in the conversation management and react accordingly.
- **Strategy pattern** allows interchangeable context-management and user profile strategies or modules easily (e.g., different profile-assignment strategies or context limitation strategies).

---

## 📌 Step 4. Ranking Design Patterns by Importance For Your App:

Now, given the critical characteristics of your app requirements and architecture described clearly so far, we select and rank our top three priority patterns as follows:

| Rank | Pattern                        | Justification / Explanation |
|------|--------------------------------|-----------------------------|
| #1   | **Strategy Pattern**           | Highest flexibility: Managing dynamically changeable behaviors/models essential in configurable chatbot environments. Allowing run-time behavior updates both for models and user contexts. |
| #2   | **Facade Pattern**             | Essential separation-of-concerns strategy: abstracts complexity, simplifies APIs handling complex interactions with external APIs (OpenAI), authentication, and logging. |
| #3   | **Observer Pattern**           | Highly desirable: Helps decoupled event propagation, enforces clean event-driven actions occurring when interactions or behaviors in chats change (conversation updates, user data/store updates). |

---

## 🚩 **Summary of Recommended Patterns per Section:**

Here's a quick summary of the strategic sections and recommended patterns:

| Strategic Section                       | Recommended Patterns                           |
|-----------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| User Authentication & Session Management | Singleton, Facade                              |
| Model Configuration & Behavior           | Builder, Strategy                              |
| Chat Context & Conversation Management   | Memento, Observer                              |
| Prompt Generation & API Communication    | Facade, Chain of responsibility                |
| Logging and Output Management            | Decorator, Singleton                           |
| Additional Features                      | Observer, Strategy                             |

## ✅ **Next recommended steps:**
- Evaluate each suggested strategic section to confirm they align perfectly with your vision.
- Confirm the chosen design patterns match your understanding & preferences.
- Continue designing the interfaces and classes for each section using these suggestions.


User:
In this sense, I would like to start desining the login area. So, for this, I would like it to be focus on openai, and also take the opportunity to learn the patterns. So in this sense, explain the patterns first, then why to use it for the login and then how to use them


Model:
Certainly! Let's carefully break down your login component with focus on OpenAI's API key authentication, explaining clearly the design patterns we will use, why they are appropriate, and then illustrating how you can integrate and implement them.

---

## 🎯 Step-by-step Explanation of Patterns
For user authentication and session management specifically with OpenAI's API keys, the recommended design patterns are:
1. **Singleton Pattern**
2. **Facade Pattern**

Let's clearly understand each pattern first:

### ① Singleton Pattern
**Definition**: A Singleton pattern is a software design strategy where a class can have only one single instance systematically throughout the application's lifecycle. It provides a global access point to this instance.

**Use-Cases**:
- Global configuration or session manager that needs to be consistent system-wide.
- Structures like Authentication handlers, Database connections, or API key management—where a consistent state is mandatory.

**Key Benefits**:
- **Global Accessibility**: Offers an easy way to access a globally unique instance.
- **Consistency**: Ensures that there is always only one consistent system-wide instance.

---

### ② Facade Pattern
**Definition:** A Facade pattern provides a simplified and streamlined interface to complex systems, hiding internal subsystem complexities.

**Use-Cases**:
- APIs or login systems simulating centralized simplified points for interacting complex functions.
- Situations where subsystem complexity such as multiple validation processes could be abstracted with clear interfaces.

**Key Benefits**:
- **Simplifies client interaction**: Clients interact with an easy-to-understand, simple, and streamlined interface.
- **Loose coupling**: Reduces tight dependencies with internal subsystems, enhancing maintainability and modifiability.

---

## 👉 **Why Use Singleton & Facade Here?**

- **For Singleton**:
    - An API key authenticity and user session handler need to maintain a consistent credential configuration.
    - Only one copy of authentication/session information should exist to avoid conflicts or security risks.
    - Singleton guarantees a secure, unique global state for session details.

- **For Facade**:
    - Authentication (Login using OpenAI key) typically involves several small tasks:
      - Checking credential validity (format checking or remote validation).
      - Secure storage/retrieval of the API key.
      - Error handling clearly reporting potential issues like format errors, connection issues, or authentications failed.
    - A Facade assists users in provision of clean interfaces without worrying about each step's internal details.

---

## 🛠 **Concrete Implementation: Example in Python**

Here, let's consider an initial practical example:

### Step A. Singleton (Session Manager Class)

```python
class SessionManager:
    __instance = None
    
    def __new__(cls):
        if SessionManager.__instance is None:
            SessionManager.__instance = object.__new__(cls)
            SessionManager.__instance.api_key = None
            SessionManager.__instance.is_authenticated = False
        return SessionManager.__instance

    def set_api_key(self, api_key:str):
        self.api_key = api_key
        self.is_authenticated = self.validate_api_key(api_key)

    def validate_api_key(self, api_key:str):
        # Add actual validation logic, possibly checking on OpenAI's side.
        # For demonstration, we check basic provisions:
        return api_key.startswith("sk-") and len(api_key) > 20

    def clear_session(self):
        self.api_key = None
        self.is_authenticated = False
```

#### Explanation:
- We ensure only **one** instance of Session Manager exists, so any other call returns the same existing instance.
- Session handler securely stores API keys, checks validity, and manages session states.

---

### Step B. Facade (Simplified Interface for Login)

Now, we introduce a simplified authentication interface to clients/users through a Facade:

```python
class AuthenticationFacade:
    def __init__(self):
        self.session_manager = SessionManager()

    def login(self, api_key: str):
        self.session_manager.set_api_key(api_key)
        if not self.session_manager.is_authenticated:
            raise ValueError("Authentication failed: Invalid API key format")
        print("Authentication successful.")

    def logout(self):
        self.session_manager.clear_session()
        print("Logout successful.")

    def is_logged_in(self):
        return self.session_manager.is_authenticated
```

#### Explanation:
- Clients and code modules can use a simplified interface **(`login`, `logout`, `is_logged_in`)** without seeing validation or internal states.
- Facade provides user-friendly messages and error responses, enhancing clarity and maintainability.

---

## 🚀 **Actual Usage/Demonstration of Implemented Patterns**

Here's how you (as a user or a client module) could use the Facade:

```python
auth = AuthenticationFacade()

# success scenario
try:
    auth.login("sk-your-real-openai-key-1234567890")
except ValueError as e:
    print(e)

if auth.is_logged_in():
    print("Ready to use OpenAI features.")
else:
    print("Please check your credentials again")

auth.logout()
```

Example Output:
```text
Authentication successful.
Ready to use OpenAI features.
Logout successful.
```

---

## ✅ **Benefits from this Combined Singleton-Facade Design Approach:**
- **Encapsulation**: Complex and possibly security-sensitive problem (handling keys) is encapsulated neatly.
- **Maintainability**: Changes to internal logic, api checking, or validation criteria are deep inside implementation, not exposed to the client directly.
- **Global Access with Consistent State**: Singleton stores the global consistent state efficiently throughout the entire software lifecycle.
- **Simplicity/Usability**: Clear and concise API usage provided by Facade making code using authentication clean and straightforward.

---

## 🔑 **Next steps for you:**

1. Carefully review the provided examples and explanations, ensuring clear understanding of both patterns.
2. Apply this coding pattern practically, inserting the needed logic according to official OpenAI verifications for a real environment.
3. Further extend functionalities (such as more detailed validation, secure key storage techniques like environment variables or secret vaults, logging authentication events, etc.) with ease due to the established separation of responsibilities.

Once comfortable with these two design patterns within the authentication context, you can leverage them similarly in other software elements we discussed earlier.

--- 

Would you like to proceed onto the next strategic section (`Model Configuration & Behavior Management`), or do you prefer diving deeper into particular details in the present authentication design section?


User: 
Let us go back to 
2. **Model Configuration & Behavior Management**  
Can we do the same? Let us evaluate how to make it nicely. In this sense, I would like also to give you a bit more of information. OpenAI have different types of models, sometimes you can pass it an image, sometimes, you can ask for predictive output or structured output. In this sense, I am not entirely sure, whereas to enable all of this for a chatbot project. In this sense, I think it could be interesting to have some form of interface with the all the options, but specialize it for the particular case we have. Is this a common way to go? Would you then put it in the project? Or should it become a separate project? Is it possible to structure in a way it can transform into a separate project easily?


Model:

Here is our structured step-by-step approach:

1. **Restating clearly what you're asking**  
2. **Reasoning about design considerations**
3. **Selecting and explaining suitable design patterns clearly**
4. **Concrete implementation suggestions**
5. **Discussing your architecture-related questions (interface, modularity, separate project)**  

---

## ✅ Step 1: Clear Restatement of Requirements (based on your new information):

You need a flexible, extendable, and well-structured system for **Model Configuration & Behavior Management**. OpenAI has models with diverse behaviors and options:

- **Diverse input types**: Some models support pure text input-output (e.g., GPT-3.5, GPT-4), some allow multimodal inputs such as image inputs (GPT-4 Vision).
- **Diverse output needs**:  
  - Free text, conversational style outputs  
  - Structured outputs (e.g., JSON-like structures, predictive outputs)
  - Possibly dynamic behavior variations (such as allowing internet search, math solving features, etc.)

You also asked explicitly about creating a generalized interface to represent these diverse capabilities, but still specializing it as needed for a chatbot use case. Additionally, you raised good architecture questions:

- If an interface approach is common or advised  
- Whether such functionality belongs within the project itself or as a standalone library/project  
- If it can be structured in a flexible way to become its own project later on

Let us address these first clearly:

---

## 🛠 Step 2: Reasoning and Considerations (Architecture perspective):

### **Why an interface?**

- Interfaces (also called abstract base classes in Python, or "protocols") are common and beneficial when modeling diverse model behavior. 
- It allows clean **separation of concerns** (using models vs. configuring behaviour), making extension straightforward and maintainable.
- Abstract interfaces also simplify testing by clearly specifying expected method signatures without revealing internal details.

### **Should model configuration be a separate library/project or included in the main chatbot project?**

The answer often depends on the long-term plan, but the best practice indicates: 

- If there is a clear likelihood of reuse beyond your initial application (the chatbot), or if the code deals clearly with general concepts (like "Model", "Behavior configuration"), it benefits greatly from **being isolated in a self-contained module first**.  
- This isolation can be implemented initially **within your current chatbot codebase but in a separate, well-decoupled package/module structure**. This helps you to define boundaries clearly from the start.
- Later, **extracting it into a separate dedicated library** (its own "mini-project") then becomes trivial.

Thus:

> **Start modularized within your current project first, but structure it well.** Extraction into a separate standalone project later becomes simple and safe.

---

## 🎖 Step 3: Suitable Design Patterns and Rationalization

We previously identified these patterns for Model Configuration & Behavior Management:

- **Builder Pattern**: Structured construction and configuration of complex objects (models).  
- **Strategy Pattern**: Dynamically interchangeable behavior and decision logic.

Given your refined requirement (diverse models, inputs, outputs), let's now explicitly add the concept of interfaces:

- **Abstract Factory Pattern (New)**: Provide interface to create families of related objects (different models) without specifying concrete classes. Suitable when switching between significantly different objects with different configurations, capabilities and behaviors (GPT-4 text, GPT-4 vision, etc.).

Final recommended pattern set clearly:

1. **Abstract Factory Pattern**: For clearly distinguishing how to instantiate differing model capabilities and types.
2. **Builder Pattern**: To clearly handle complex stepwise construction/configuration of model capability (internet access, structured output JSON, system prompts/style definition, etc.).
3. **Strategy Pattern**: Clear run-time swapping and management of behaviors, e.g. formatting/presentation style, structured output strategies.

---

## 🚩 Step 4: Concrete Implementation Guideline (Example):

Let's illustrate this clearer:

### (1) Abstract Interface to represent various model types:

```python
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

# General abstract interface for models:
class OpenAIModel(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def generate_response(self, prompt, context):
        pass
```

### (2) Concrete Implementations (Strategy Pattern):

```python
# A Concrete Model: Text-based GPT model
class GPTTextModel(OpenAIModel):
    def __init__(self, parameters):
        self.parameters = parameters
    
    def generate_response(self, prompt, context):
        # Simplified example
        return openai.ChatCompletion.create(
                model=self.parameters["model_name"],
                messages=context + [{"role": "user", "content": prompt}],
                temperature=self.parameters["temperature"]
        )
        
# Another Concrete Model: Vision-enabled Model
class GPTVisionModel(OpenAIModel):
    def __init__(self, parameters):
        self.parameters = parameters
    
    def generate_response(self, prompt, context, images):
        # Imaginary example (simplified!)
        return openai.ChatCompletion.create(
                model=self.parameters["model_name"],
                messages=context + [{"role": "user", "content": prompt, "images": images}],
                temperature=self.parameters["temperature"]
        )
```

### (3) Builder Pattern for structured construction:

```python
class ModelBuilder:
    def __init__(self):
        self.parameters = {}
        
    def set_model_name(self, model_name):
        self.parameters["model_name"] = model_name
        return self
        
    def enable_structured_output(self, structured: bool):
        self.parameters["structured"] = structured
        return self
    
    def set_temperature(self, temp: float):
        self.parameters["temperature"] = temp
        return self
    
    def allow_internet_access(self, allow: bool):
        self.parameters["internet_allowed"] = allow
        return self
    
    def build(self):
        if "vision" in self.parameters["model_name"]:
            return GPTVisionModel(self.parameters)
        else:
            return GPTTextModel(self.parameters)
```

---

## 🚀 Step 5: Integration and future extraction to standalone module

To structure your project now but ensure easy extraction later, simply structure your code as follows:

✓ **In your current project:**

```
project_root/
├── chatbot/         # main chatbot modules and logic
│   ├── main.py
│   └── conversation.py
│
├── openai_models/    # clearly separated modeling module
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── models.py
│   ├── builder.py
│   ├── interfaces.py
│   └── strategies.py
│
├── authentication/
│   ├── __init__.py
│   └── auth.py
│
├── logging/
│   ├── __init__.py
│   └── logger.py
│
└── profiles/      
    ├── __init__.py
    └── user_profiles.py
```

This keeps modules internally organized and **loosely coupled**, easy unit-tested and extendable.

✓ **Later, if model configuration becomes reusable and grows**:

You simply repackage the `openai_models` folder independently with minimal changes, publishing as an independent module/library. No major refactoring needed due to clean separation of concerns from the start.

---

## ⚡ **SUMMARY / RECOMMENDED APPROACH CLEARLY STATED**:

- Use **Abstract Factory, Builder, and Strategy** patterns in combination to handle your diverse model capabilities and behavior flexibility.
- Create generalized interfaces with clearly separated concerns/interfaces to handle diverse OpenAI models conveniently.
- Initially incubate the functionality as a modularized and separate component within your existing chatbot project.  
- Clearly structure your software for easy extraction later into an independent library.

**This approach is highly common, professionally recommended, clean, maintainable, extendable, and reusable.**

---

## ✅ **Next recommended steps:**
- Consider and validate clearly the structured example provided above.
- Confirm your understandings about the Abstract Factory, Strategy, Builder and Interface approaches explained.
- Next, either we refine further about **API submission & response handling** or continue clarifying this module first.

Let me know how you would like to move on!

User:

I am failing to see, where did you used strategies, and also, how should I organize functions and files

Model:
You are right to question where **Strategy pattern** was explicitly represented. Let's clarify, simplify, and illustrate how to explicitly apply the **Strategy pattern** clearly in addition to the previous **Abstract Factory** and **Builder** patterns. Afterward, let's discuss clearly how should you organize files and functions properly, step by step.

---

## 🚩 Step 1: **Clearly Understand the Strategy Pattern**

### **What is the Strategy Pattern?**

**Strategy** pattern recognizes that certain classes or objects share common behavior but differ in how specific behaviors or algorithms are implemented. It clearly enables the dynamic selection of behaviors at **runtime**.

### Example context for Strategy pattern in your scenario:

- Different ways to format a model's output (markdown, JSON, plain text).
- Different types of prompts (structured prompt, conversational style prompt, or system messages stylizing outputs dynamically).
- Different methods to preprocess input or post-process outputs dynamically.

These are clear candidates for different interchangeable strategies.

---

## 🚩 Step 2: **Illustrating clearly the Strategy pattern implementation**

For clarity, let's illustrate using **output formatting strategies** as an explicit and illustrative example:

### Define a strategy interface:

```python
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

class OutputFormattingStrategy(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def format(self, response_content: str):
        pass
```

### Implement different concrete strategies:

```python
import json

class PlainTextStrategy(OutputFormattingStrategy):
    def format(self, response_content: str):
        return response_content.strip()

class MarkdownStrategy(OutputFormattingStrategy):
    def format(self, response_content: str):
        # Return Markdown formatted response
        return response_content

class JsonStrategy(OutputFormattingStrategy):
    def format(self, response_content: str):
        try:
            # Attempt to convert from model output (which might be text) into dict
            return json.loads(response_content)
        except json.JSONDecodeError:
            raise ValueError("Response content is not valid JSON")
```

### Integrate clearly into Model Classes:

The Strategy is then **composed into our models**, allowing dynamic interchangeability clearly at runtime.

```python
class GPTTextModel(OpenAIModel):
    def __init__(self, parameters, output_strategy: OutputFormattingStrategy):
        self.parameters = parameters
        self.format_strategy = output_strategy

    def generate_response(self, prompt, context):
        raw_result = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
                        model=self.parameters["model_name"],
                        messages=context + [{"role": "user", "content": prompt}],
                        temperature=self.parameters["temperature"]
                     )
        response_content = raw_result["choices"][0]["message"]["content"]
        return self.format_strategy.format(response_content)
```

### Dynamically assign a strategy at runtime:

```python
# User decides strategy at runtime:
output_format = "json"  # run-time chosen option

if output_format == "json":
    strategy = JsonStrategy()
elif output_format == "markdown":
    strategy = MarkdownStrategy()
else:
    strategy = PlainTextStrategy()

my_model = GPTTextModel(parameters, strategy)
```

**Here you CLEARLY SEE Strategy pattern in action:** The model configuration remains the same, but formatting strategy is interchangeable **at runtime.**

---

## 🚩 Step 3: **Files and Directory Organization Clearly Explained:**

Here is a **clearly organized and widely recommended structure** of your project:

## 🚩 **What Clearly Goes in Each File:**

**openai_models/interfaces.py**  
- Define `OpenAIModel` (abstract base class interface)

**openai_models/strategies.py**  
- Output formatting strategies (`PlainTextStrategy`, `MarkdownStrategy`, `JsonStrategy`, etc.)

**openai_models/models.py**  
- Concrete Model implementations (`GPTTextModel`, `GPTVisionModel`, etc.)

**openai_models/model_builder.py**  
- Fluent Builder-pattern class (`ModelBuilder`), helps configure complex model parameters clearly.

**openai_models/model_factory.py**  
- Uses Abstract Factory to clearly instantiate different concrete model types based on parameters provided.

**authentication/auth.py**  
- Singleton and Facade for user/authentication management as previously explained clearly.

---

## 🚩 Step 4: **How These Patterns Fit Together Clearly (Visual Flow):**

When user initiates the chatbot app (`main.py`), the logical flow would proceed clearly like this:

```
User --> AuthenticationFacade (Facade pattern)
                  |
                  v
          SessionManager (Singleton Pattern)
                  |
                  v
ModelBuilder  --> ModelFactory (Abstract Factory)
                      |
                      v
                   creates correct Model (Strategy pattern gets injected here)
                      |
                      v
User & Conversation (in chat_interface.py)
```

This is clearly how patterns intertwine, complement each other, and cleanly separate logic in a modular architecture.

---

## 🚩 Step 5: **How to Move to a Standalone Library Later Clearly:**

### Clearly follow these good guidelines from the start to simplify extraction later:

- Keep `openai_models/` completely self-contained (no unnecessary, strong coupling to external modules such as authentication or logging).
- **Limit external dependencies**: Think carefully before model-module explicitly referencing chatbot-specific functionality. Use parameters or callbacks clearly instead.
- Have clearly defined interfaces at entry points (`interfaces.py`, `model_factory.py`) preventing external modules to know internals excessively.
- Unit tests: Keep good coverage under `openai_models/tests/` to ensure you extract confidently.

By clearly following above, extracting to a standalone library in future just becomes:

1. Copy/paste the clearly defined and encapsulated module.
2. Add standalone metadata (`setup.py` or `pyproject.toml`)
3. Publish. (Minimal or no code refactoring required)

---

## ✅ **Summary Clearly Explained (Closing remarks):**

- **Strategy Pattern clarified**: Explicitly shown how it's useful for runtime interchangeable behaviors (e.g., formatting).
- **Suggested clear file/directory structure:** Using commonly recommended Python project layout tailored for your scenario.
- **Clear guidance given for standalone extraction:** Ensuring clear boundaries from the outset with carefully designed interfaces and encapsulation.

✅ You now have a complete understanding clearly specifying:

- **Why, Where, and How clearly use Strategy design patterns explicitly.**
- **Recommended nicely structured filesystem clearly stated.**

---

## 🚀 **Recommended Next Steps Clearly:**

- Implement a simple prototype clearly following above recommended architecture.
- Refine explicitly each module and class methods/interfaces clearly.
- Optionally proceed further clearly building: **Conversation management (Memento, Observer)** or **Prompt management/API communication (Facade, Chain of Responsibility)**—based on your choice.

Let me know clearly how you'd like to proceed next!

User:
Ok, now let us move to 
3. **Chat Context & Conversation Management**  
Can we do the same? Let us evaluate how to make it nicely. In this sense, I would like also to give you a bit more of information. Sometimes you might want to have different roles, or tones defined. I think they should be storage somehow in the user session, but we could assume they are generated. So, I believe context should be very flexible. Is there a common way to go? What patterns are recommended? How to structure the files?

Model:

Certainly! Let's approach **Chat Context & Conversation Management** step-by-step, clearly exploring your needs, design considerations, patterns, and recommended implementations.

# 📌Step 1: Clarify your requirements clearly again:

Your current task is about "**Chat Context & Conversation Management**", specifically:

- Storing user-chat state indexes, conversation history.
- Context-aware conversation (keep track of used context length).
- Flexible management of different types of prompt roles or tones.
- Allowing dynamic modifications to the conversational behavior or tone at runtime.
- Storing user-specific data (possibly dynamically generated contexts, tones, roles).
- Ensuring decoupled modules for better maintainability, testability, and flexibility.

---

# 🧩Step 2: Design considerations & reasoning clearly explained:

Key properties we want in "**Chat Context & Conversation Management**":

- **Flexibility:** You want to easily define, modify, and switch different contexts (personas, tones, styles) at runtime.
- **State persistence:** Conversation must keep continuity, history, and let us control how much context gets used or truncated.
- **Decoupling and Event-driven design:** Changes to context or conversation should notify interested modules, like loggers or UI updates, without tight coupling or high complexity.
- **Dynamic extensibility:** It should easily adapt additional or specialized context types (roles, scenarios, etc.) without big refactoring.

---

# 🛠 Step 3: Recommended Design Patterns & Justification clearly stated:

Your earlier GPT response recommended the following two relevant patterns for Chat Context & Conversation Management:

### (1) **Memento Pattern**:

**Definition**:
  - Clearly separates an object's state from its actual business logic, allowing you to save the internal state of an object (the conversation) separately and restore it when needed, preserving conversational checkpoints.

**Reasoning clearly explained**:
- Great for implementing checkpoints, undo procedures, or conversation recovery.
- If conversation state needs clearly managed restore points or recovery, this is excellent.

### (2) **Observer Pattern**:

**Definition**:
- Defines one-to-many dependency clearly. Observers are automatically notified when the observable object (subject) changes state.

**Reasoning clearly explained**:
- Useful when conversational behavior is modified (new persona, tone, role).
- Can automatically notify other parts of your app (like redesigning GUI/UI, logs, analytics) about changes clearly and efficiently without tightly coupling these parts.

### Additionally (Your new point about flexible roles and tones clearly suggests another useful pattern):

### (3) Strategy Pattern (again):

Given your flexibility in contexts (different roles like formal person, casual friend, technical assistant), clearly this is again the Strategy Pattern since these contexts represent clearly interchangeable behaviors/strategies.

- A "contextual tone" or "conversational behavior" can clearly be encapsulated into strategies.
- Strategies for roles or tones clearly define the conversational style and tone dynamically.

**Thus, final clearly recommended patterns:**
- **Memento Pattern** (state handling clearly)
- **Observer Pattern** (automatic event-driven notifications clearly)
- **Strategy Pattern** (interchangeable conversation tone handling clearly)

---

# 🚩Step 4: Concrete representation: Illustration (Implementation clearly):

Let's clearly illustrate how we apply these three clearly defined patterns concretely:

### (i) Context State Management using Memento Pattern:

```python
# The Memento (easy-to-store conversation state)
class ConversationMemento:
    def __init__(self, history, role):
        self.history = history.copy()  # conversation history
        self.role = role              # current conversational role and style

# Originator: Stores current conversation clearly, creates and restores clearly defined mementos/states.
class ConversationManager:
    def __init__(self, role_strategy):
        self.history = []
        self.role_strategy = role_strategy

    def save_state(self):
        return ConversationMemento(self.history, self.role_strategy)

    def restore_state(self, memento):
        self.history = memento.history.copy()
        self.role_strategy = memento.role

    def add_message(self, role, content):
        self.history.append({"role": role, "content": content})

    def generate_response(self, prompt, model):
        formatted_prompt = self.role_strategy.format_prompt(prompt)
        response = model.generate_response(formatted_prompt, context=self.history)
        self.add_message("assistant", response)
        return response
```

---

### (ii) Observer clearly accepting notifications of context changes (Observer Pattern):

```python
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

# Observer Interface (clearly defined)
class Observer(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def update(self, new_context):
        pass

# Observable (Subject clearly defined):
class ConversationContextObservable:
    def __init__(self):
        self.observers = []

    def register(self, observer: Observer):
        self.observers.append(observer)

    def unregister(self, observer: Observer):
        self.observers.remove(observer)

    def notify(self, new_context):
        for obs in self.observers:
            obs.update(new_context)
```

This allows modules like your logging service or UI controller clearly observing conversation events without tightly coupling logic.

---

### (iii) Strategy clearly managing role and tone dynamically:

```python
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

# Abstract strategy interface for different conversation styles or roles
class RoleStrategy(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def format_prompt(self, prompt):
        pass

# Concrete strategies clearly defined:
class CasualFriendRole(RoleStrategy):
    def format_prompt(self, prompt):
        return f"🙌 {prompt}, buddy!"

class FormalAssistantRole(RoleStrategy):
    def format_prompt(self, prompt):
        return f"📋 Assistant, please provide assistance clearly regarding: {prompt}"

class TechnicalAdvisorRole(RoleStrategy):
    def format_prompt(self, prompt):
        return f"🛠️ Technical Detail Request: {prompt}"
```

---

### (iv) Integrating all three patterns clearly:

Use like this inside your chat:

```python
context_observable = ConversationContextObservable()
# observers could be Logger, UI handler, etc.

# Starting conversation with formal assistant clearly:
role = FormalAssistantRole()
conversation_manager = ConversationManager(role)

# User can dynamically change role/tone clearly mid-conversation:
new_role = CasualFriendRole()
conversation_manager.role_strategy = new_role

# Notify observers about the change:
context_observable.notify(new_role)

# Save state clearly:
saved_state = conversation_manager.save_state()

# Restore later clearly:
conversation_manager.restore_state(saved_state)
```

---

# 📁Step 5: File-structure clearly recommendation for this component clearly specified:

Here's how you could clearly structure this part of your project clearly and professionally:

```
project_root/
├── chat_context/
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── conversation.py                  # manages conversation state (Memento)
│   ├── context_observable.py            # handles observers and notifications clearly (Observer)
│   ├── role_strategies.py               # clearly defined role strategies (Strategy)
│   └── memento.py                       # state management explicitly (Memento)
```

---

# 📌Step 6: Common Industry Solution Clearly Explained (Is this common way?):

The combination of Memento + Observer + Strategy is very strong, very commonly recommended, and considered great practice clearly across industry-standard solutions:

- **Memento pattern** is common for conversational/chat flows state storage in applications needing recovery/process-restore features clearly.
- **Observer pattern** is widely used for event-driven modules, GUIs, and application event logs, in chat apps and elsewhere clearly.
- **Strategy pattern** is extremely common clearly for managing interchangeable formatting, styles, personas, or conversational behaviors.

In conclusion, clearly speaking, applying these three combined for your case is indeed a commonly advised and well-estabilished practice in software design of conversational AI and chatbot systems clearly.

---

# 🚀Step 7: Future Expandability (Why flexibility matters clearly stated):

Clearly structuring roles, tones, and contexts as Strategies together with Observers and Memento for states guarantees:

- **Clear decoupling**: Easy to modify or extend roles without refactoring.
- **Clear extensibility and scalability**: Adding new conversational behaviors/tones simply involves implementing new clearly-defined Strategies.
- **Ease testing** clearly-written unit tests for each strategy separately without affecting other components.

This careful clear structuring from the outset explicitly eases future maintainability clearly.

---

# ✅ Summary of clear recommendation:

| Recommended Pattern | Clearly explained application |
|---------------------|------------------------------------|
| **Memento**         | Clearly defined conversation state storage/recovery easily|
| **Observer**        | Clearly-defined event-driven communication for modules |
| **Strategy**        | Explicitly defines different interchangeable conversational tones or roles |

- **File structure strongly recommended:** clearly defined (`chat_context`) sub-module containing clearly organized files around conversation management, states, strategies, and observable clearly specified.

---

## 🚩 Next Steps Clearly Suggested:

- Implement now a clearly simplified initial prototype using specified structure clearly recommended above and iterate from there clearly.
- Test explicitly defined individual modules clearly (memento-state saving, observable - observer notifications, and interchangeable strategies/roles).
- Feel free to then clearly move to the **"Prompt Generation & API communication"** strategic section.

Please let me know clearly if this covers your concerns clearly or if there is anything further you want to clarify or clearly refine!

User: 
Now I want to continue with the 
4. **Prompt Generation and API communication**  

Please do the same as you did before. 

Model:
Certainly! Let's continue step-by-step, carefully and clearly, to address **Prompt Generation and API Communication**.

---

## ✅ Step 1. Clear Restatement of Requirements 

This component involves:

- **Prompt generation** that integrates:
  - Current conversation history (context).
  - Current role/behavior strategies (tones defined previously).
  - User prompts, possibly with structured formats and multimedia support.

- **API communication**:
  - Submitting prepared prompts to OpenAI models.
  - Handling API responses with proper error handling, retries, throttling.
  - Managing request limits, failures, or format issues.
- The subsystem should be easily adaptable to potential model changes, input format variations (text/images), and distinct preprocessing/postprocessing rules clearly.

---

## 🛠 Step 2. Strategic Software Design Considerations 

Key software architecture qualities to consider clearly:

- **Decoupling**: Clearly separate API request mechanisms from core logic and prompt building.
- **Flexibility & Extensibility**: Easily allow future changes to prompt formats, preprocessing rules, adding new AI services or endpoints.
- **Responsibility Clarity**: Components clearly separated by responsibility (prompt handling, API interfacing).
- **Maintainability & Testability**: Easier unit tests on individual components separately.
- **Error Resilience and logging**: Clearly defined mechanisms to handle API request errors, logging, and event management.

---

## 🚩 Step 3. Recommended Design Patterns and Reasoning Clearly Stated

For this section, previously the patterns recommended were:

- **Facade Pattern**
- **Chain of Responsibility Pattern**

Let's carefully clarify each clearly and why they are ideal:

### (①) Facade Pattern clearly explained:

**Definition:**  
- Provides a simple interface clearly encapsulating complex API communication logic, error handling, and response management.

**Why Use? Clearly stated Reasoning:**  
- External API (OpenAI service) communications involve complex tasks (authentication, retries, error parsing, timeout handling).  
- A Facade clearly simplifies interfacing parts for other subsystems, ensuring simple calls and manageable interactions clearly abstracted away.

### (②) Chain of Responsibility clearly explained:

**Definition:**  
- Decouples the request handling into "pipeline"-style components or handlers clearly, passing the request along sequential processors until processed, allowing easy addition/removal of preprocessing or post-processing rules clearly.

**Why Use? Clearly stated Reasoning:**  
- A flexible way clearly handling multiple aspects of prompts/responses such as:
  - Validating and transforming prompts.
  - Truncating or summarizing contexts if exceeding length limits.
  - Checking compatibility input types (image/text).
  - Handling structured outputs or specific formatting rules dynamically.

---

## 🚀 Step 4. Concrete Example Implementation clearly explained:

Let's illustrate clearly:

### (I) Facade Implementation: Simple API Facade

Clearly provides simplified interface for calling API:

```python
class OpenAIFacade:
    def __init__(self, auth_facade):
        self.auth_facade = auth_facade

    def send_prompt(self, model, prompt_messages, temperature=0.7):
        if not self.auth_facade.is_logged_in():
            raise PermissionError("User not authenticated. Please log in.")

        try:
            response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
                model=model,
                messages=prompt_messages,
                temperature=temperature
            )
            return response
        except openai.error.RateLimitError:
            print("Rate limit reached! Try back later.")
        except openai.error.OpenAIError as e:
            print(f"API Error: {e}")
```

---

### (II). Chain of Responsibility clearly explained:

Let's clearly manage prompt pre-processing:

Define an abstract handler:

```python
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

class PromptHandler(ABC):
    def __init__(self, successor=None):
        self._successor = successor

    @abstractmethod
    def handle(self, prompt, context):
        if self._successor:
            return self._successor.handle(prompt, context)
        return prompt, context
```

Define concrete handlers clearly:

```python
class ContextLengthHandler(PromptHandler):
    def __init__(self, max_length, successor=None):
        super().__init__(successor)
        self.max_length = max_length

    def handle(self, prompt, context):
        # Simplified length check/reduction logic
        total_content = ''.join([msg['content'] for msg in context]) + prompt
        if len(total_content) > self.max_length:
            print("Truncating context due to max length")
            context = context[-3:]  # keep last 3 messages for example
        return super().handle(prompt, context)

class FormatHandler(PromptHandler):
    def handle(self, prompt, context):
        # Ensure prompt is correctly formatted (adding possible system prompt)
        prompt = prompt.strip()
        return super().handle(prompt, context)
```

### Chain set up clearly:

```python
handler_chain = ContextLengthHandler(
    max_length=4000,
    successor=FormatHandler()
)
```

Usage Example clearly demonstrating chaining:

```python
final_prompt, final_context = handler_chain.handle(user_prompt, previous_context)
```

---

### (III). How they integrate clearly together?

Clearly summarized integration example:

```python
# User submits chat prompt:
model = "gpt-4"
user_prompt = "Explain strategy pattern."

# Create handler chain clearly:
handler_chain = ContextLengthHandler(4000, successor=FormatHandler())

# Preprocess prompt/context clearly:
final_prompt, context = handler_chain.handle(user_prompt, conversation_history)

# Use facade to clearly handle communication to API:
auth_facade = AuthenticationFacade()
api_facade = OpenAIFacade(auth_facade)

response = api_facade.send_prompt(
    model=model,
    prompt_messages=context + [{"role": "user", "content": final_prompt}],
    temperature=0.7
)
```

---

## 📁 Step 5. Recommended File Structure clearly defined:

Clearly suggested structure within your overall project:

```
project_root/
├── prompt_api/                         
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── openai_facade.py           # Facade for API communication
│   ├── handlers.py                # Chain of responsibility handler classes
│   └── interfaces.py              # Common handler interfaces
```

---

## 📌 Step 6. Commonality & Best Practices (clearly explained):

The combined use of **Facade** and **Chain of Responsibility** pattern is **highly common and recommended** in modern applications involving API integrations and middleware pipelines:

- **Facade Pattern:** widely common pattern clarifying complex APIs or third-party integrations into clearly manageable interfaces.
- **Chain of Responsibility:** well-adapted clearly to pre/post-processing or validation pipelines—extremely common clearly in modular pipelines or API middleware designs (like data validation, logging, and preprocessing).

Thus, it's widely adopted, commonly taught, and considered strongly good practice clearly.

---

## 🔄 Step 7. Future Proofing (clearly stated):

Applying Facade and Chain of Responsibility clearly ensures:

- Easily extend/maintain clear separation of prompt processing logic.
- Clearly adding new preprocessor/postprocessor modules easily, without large refactoring.
- Facade easily adapted later if you switch to another API or provider clearly.

---

## ✅ **Summary & Recommended Approach clearly restated:**

| Recommended Pattern | Clearly explained application |
|---------------------|------------------------------------|
| **Facade** | Simplifies complex API calling and error handling clearly |
| **Chain of Responsibility** | Modular, clearly separated and extensible request processing |

- Clearly structured `prompt_api` folder recommended above.

---

## 🚀 Next Recommended Steps clearly restated:

- Implement a simple testable prototype clearly using above examples and file structures.
- Clearly think of possible extra handlers required based on your specific needs (structuring formatting, prompt validation, error checking, etc.).
- Confirm tests (unit & integration) for each handler clearly, ensuring individual correctness and easy maintenance clearly.

With this strategic section completed explicitly:

We have now carefully covered **4 critical sections** of your architecture, clearly and step-by-step! 

We can continue systematically proceeding to the **Logging and Output management** strategic section next, or you let me know clearly if you need additional refinements or details!

User, Ok, let us summarize at this point the whole project. In this sense, what its the common way to write a wwhite paper explaining the package as it is now. Please also include a diagram of the file structures, with a brief description, that includes the design pattern of each file. 

In the white paper documentation, explain the reasoning.
